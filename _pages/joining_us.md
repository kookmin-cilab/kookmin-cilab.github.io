### Joining Us
We are looking for new group members! If you wish to become a part of our lab, please send an email to [Seongwon Lee]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/members).

#### Research Topics

Our lab is dedicated to advancing the field of computer vision and its integration with robotics. We aim to create intelligent systems capable of perceiving, interpreting, and interacting with the world through visual data. Our research spans several key areas, including multimodal perception, robot vision, 3D reconstruction, and visual data for robot navigation and manipulation. We also explore foundational topics in vision-based learning, enabling robots to understand complex environments and perform tasks autonomously. We strive to publish high-quality research in leading AI and robotics venues, contributing to the latest advancements in these fields.
